    Rebuild for numpy 2.0
    
    TL;DR: The way we build against numpy has changed as of numpy 2.0. This bot
    PR has updated the recipe to account for the changes (see below for details).
    
    The biggest change is that we no longer need to use the oldest available numpy
    version at build time in order to support old numpy version at runtime - numpy
    will by default use a compatible ABI for the oldest still-supported numpy versions.
    
    Additionally, we no longer need to use `{{ pin_compatible("numpy") }}` as a
    run requirement - this has been handled for more than two years now by a
    run-export on the numpy package itself. The migrator will therefore remove
    any occurrences of this.
    
    However, by default, building against numpy 2.0 will assume that the package
    is compatible with numpy 2.0, which is not necessarily the case. You should
    check that the upstream package explicitly supports numpy 2.0, otherwise you
    need to add a `- numpy <2.0dev0` run requirement until that happens (check numpy
    issue 26191 for an overview of the most important packages).
    
    ### To-Dos:
      * [ ] Match run-requirements for numpy (i.e. check upstream `pyproject.toml` or however the project specifies numpy compatibility)
        * If upstream is not yet compatible with numpy 2.0, add `numpy <2.0dev0` upper bound under `run:`.
        * If upstream is already compatible with numpy 2.0, nothing else should be necessary in most cases.
        * If upstream requires a minimum numpy version newer than 1.19, you can add `numpy >=x.y` under `run:`.
      * [ ] Remove any remaining occurrences of `{{ pin_compatible("numpy") }}` that the bot may have missed.
    
    PS. If the build does not compile anymore, this is almost certainly a sign that
    the upstream project is not yet ready for numpy 2.0; do not close this PR until
    a version compatible with numpy 2.0 has been released upstream and on this
    feedstock (in the meantime, you can keep the bot from reopening this PR in
    case of git conflicts by marking it as a draft).
